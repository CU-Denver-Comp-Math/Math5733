    "\n",
    "- To review some basic notation/terminology and prerequisite knowledge useful for the study of PDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To introduce concepts such as stability and numerical discretization on simple problems that set the stage for more complicated problems we see later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To introduce the analytic solutions and their behaviors/properties to some simple problems (that may not seem so simple when we discuss their solutions) that set the stage for further study.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To introduce various Python packages, tools, and techniques for investigating solutions (numerical or closed-form) on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter *sets the scene* for the rest of the course. It also *buys students time* in getting up to speed on prerequisite material and Python programming required to do well in this course."

    "**About this material:**\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks follow the thematic structure of the text <u>*Introduction to Partial Differential Equations: A Computational Approach*</u> by Tveito and Winther. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional material and perspectives are either my own or adapted/adopted from the OER textbook <u>Partial Differential Equations</u> by Victor Ivrii from the University or Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of these notebooks is multifaceted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, these notebooks provide a narrative of each chapter that guides students through their initial studies of partial differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, it is often very easy when reading mathematical texts to get lost in the details. These notebooks are intended to keep you centered on the take home messages and the big picture while you work through the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Third, these notebooks will help guide our in-class discussions. We use these to provide structure and guidance on which ideas, techniques, and problems we will explore in more detail in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fourth, these notebooks are also intended to help solidify the connections between chapters, ideas, techniques, and problems that may be easily overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fifth, and finally, these notebooks are intended to bridge the divide between the theoretical concepts and the practical implementation/numerical approximations by interweaving live code within the narrative text. \n",
    "\n",
    "I make no claim of originality in these notes. The field of partial differential equations is vast and there are many texts and other resources on the subject matter. These simply represent my attempt at presenting a coherent narrative that students find useful, informative, and, perhaps above all else, practical."
