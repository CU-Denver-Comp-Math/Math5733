    "## Section 1.4: Cauchy Problems\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This section involves PDEs depending upon a single spatial variable $x$ with spatial domain $\\Omega=\\mathbb{R}$ (so there is no boundary) and time $t$. We have an initial condition (IC) at $t=0$, so these are called [Cauchy problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_problem). We often refer to them simply as initial value problems (IVPs) for short since we only dela with Cauchy problems involving initial conditions at $t=0$ in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaways from this section:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The motivation is to introduce some simple solutions (and hint at certain solution strategies) to equations that will be studied in more detail later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The method of characteristics is first introduced to solve problems of this type. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The main idea is to identify curves in the $(x,t)$-plane, written in the form $(x(t),t)$, that make it possible to write the solution to the PDE in terms of the initial data and these curves. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The way this is done is by exploiting certain structure in the PDE to determine an ODE whose solution gives the desirable curve (i.e., characteristic). It is best observed by example.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The examples we initially explore in [Sections 1.4.1](#Section1.4.1) and [1.4.2](#Section1.4.2) are for hyperbolic transport equations (i.e., there is no diffusion which is evidenced by the complete lack of second order spatial derivatives). \n",
    "\n",
    "  This is related to [Activities 1.4.1](#Activity1.4.1) and [1.4.2](#Activity1.4.2) that we will cover in class although some parts are left for homework. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In [Section 1.4.3](#Section1.4.3), the wave equation is introduced and a clever changes of variables is used to demonstrate that the solution can be written as the sum of two functions in the new variables that physically represent the way that a wave would propagate in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is related to [Activity 1.4.3](#Activity1.4.3), which we will go over in class.\n",
    " \n",
    "- In [Section 1.4.4](#Section1.4.4), the heat equation is introduced (this is a transport equation with diffusion and is classified as a parabolic PDE). Again, through a creative change of variables, we see how to leverage calculus of a single variable concepts to solve this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Equations like the heat equation have the property that they smooth out rough initial data *instantly*. \n",

Specifically, $u$ is not defined on characteristic curves that do not intersect $x=0$, so we cannot determine what $u$ is for any $(x,t)$ such that $x>0.5t^2$. Lame.\n",

When we stick with an IC based on $t=0$, then in the $(x,t)$-plane we see that each characteristic curve intersects the $x$-axis (i.e., where $t=0$) exactly once and the IVP is said to be *well-posed* because solutions exist and are unique."

Picture in your mind how you slow up to a \"pile of cars\" on the highway and then, seemingly miraculously, you arrive at some magical point at the end of the congestion where you can speed up again even though you still see a mess of cars in your rear view mirror. What happened? Mathematics happened!\n",

    "- It is reasonable to assume that $v(u)=g(u)u$ has a single maximum at some $u^*$ (i.e., there is a density where the group velocity associated with this density defines the largest flux). Do a thought experiment to reason this. If there is a single car traveling on the highway, then no matter how fast it is traveling, there is still a small flux. If there are too many cars on the highway so that traffic is \"crawling\", then there is a small flux. But, if there is a \"goldilocks\" number of cars on the road where a reasonably fast speed can be maintained with a reasonable number of cars, then the flux is probably \"optimally maximized.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Notice that $b(u)>0$ as $u<u^*$, which means that the phase velocity is positive so $x = x_0 + b(u)t$ is an increasing function, i.e., as time increases, the density of cars is moving forward in terms of transporting the density of cars in positive miles traveled.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - On the other hand, $b(u)<0$ if $u>u^*$, in which case $x=x_0 + b(u)t$ is *decreasing*, i.e., as time increases, the density of cars is failing to \"move forward\" and the congestion is increasing by backing up the density of cars. This is what happens with a growing traffic jam.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Going back to the integral lines, they may intersect because of this change of direction of $b(u)$. This means that \"loose and faster\" moving congestion catches up with \"dense and slower\" congestion. When that happens, $u$ becomes discontinuous and the theory becomes complicated. \n",
