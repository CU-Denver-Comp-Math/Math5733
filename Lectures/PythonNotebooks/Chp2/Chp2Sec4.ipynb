    "\n",
    "  - We will show that any eigenvalues must actually be real (i.e., have zero imaginary component) due to the symmetry of the operators $L$ and $L_h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a given eigenvalue $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$ (see the above remark), there is no unique way to represent the eigenfunction because any non-zero multiple of this eigenfunction also defines an eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue. \n",

    "  In other words, if $u$ is a continuous eigenfunction associated with $\\lambda$, then so is $\\alpha u$ for any $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}-\\{0\\}$, which is verified by direct substitution into the eigenvalue problem.\n",

    "- Some aspects of modern PDE theory rely on analysis of the [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(functional_analysis)) of the differential operator. The spectrum is a generalization of the concept of eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing the eigenvalues/spectrum of an operator gives us a lot of information about the solvability of problems and any conditions on the data that are required for a solution to exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Consider the classic linear algebra $Av=\\lambda v$ eigenvalue problem (obviously $A$ is a square matrix - why is this obvious?). If $\\lambda=0$ is an eigenvalue, then it tells us that the nullspace of $A$ is non-empty. Moreover, this tells us that $Ax=b$ can only be solved for *some* $b$ and that for the $b$ we can choose for which a solution to $Ax=b$ exists, we also know that the solutions are not unique because we can add to these solutions any vector in the nullspace of $A$. The lesson is that linear algebra is a subject too often taken for granted."
